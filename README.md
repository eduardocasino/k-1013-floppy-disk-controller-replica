# K-1013 Floppy Disk Controller replica

## Introduction

Welcome to my K-1013 Rev. D Floppy Disk Controller replica repository.

This aims to be a faithful replica of the K-1013 Floppy Disk Controller, an extension board for the KIM-1 designed by MTU in the late 70's/early 80's for interfacing with [Shugart Associates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shugart_Associates) compatible 8'' and 5.25'' FDDs.

### Status

Schematic is completed and checked against the real board.

Routing is completed, still in revision.
